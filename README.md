# Pathfinding Visualisation

## Preamble
A fun day-project to visualise path finding algorithms in Python.

## Introduction
Pathfinding Visualisation is an interactive tool built with Tkinter that enables users to explore and understand how different pathfinding algorithms work. This application allows users to customise the maze dimensions, the density of the walls, and the speed of the visualisation process. It's designed to visualize up to 9 pathfinding algorithms simultaneously, providing a comparative view of their performance and methodology from a start location to an end location.

## Features
- Set custom dimensions for the maze grid.
- Adjustable density of walls to create unique scenarios.
- Control over the visualisation speed.
- Ability to select and compare multiple different pathfinding algorithms.
- Interactive GUI for ease of use and better user experience.

## Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a GUI where you can:
- Set the maze size and wall density.
- Choose the algorithms you wish to visualise.
- Start and observe the pathfinding process in action.

## Future Work
- Adding more algorithms.
- Optimising existing algorithms for speed.
- Refactoring pathfinding algorithms to use iterators for improved memory efficiency.
- Enhancing the visual appeal of the pathfinding visualisation, including color customisation.
- Implementing a stats display to provide insights into algorithm performance.
- Overall UI overhaul for a more intuitive experience.
